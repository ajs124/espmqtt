*This fork is (mostly) obsolet!*

upstream seems to use mbedtls directly now and looks like it's able to verify certificates.
I have not actualyl verified that as of writing this (2018-02-23), but their new README talks about specifying a cert, so that looks promising.
Also, this fork has apparently diverged enough that merging it seems like a hassle.
I'll (try to) use the upstream version in a project soon and might update this README then.
